# We use "vpath %.EXT", which is a GNU Make specific extension,
# instead of VPATH, as this ensures that object files (*.o) and so
# on, are not accidentally picked up from the wrong directory.
# This is mostly relevant when one has both an active "in-tree"
# build as well as "out-of-tree" builds. In that case, the out-of-tree
# builds could incorrectly pick up object files etc. from the in-tree
# build.
